2. Place the device adapter plate on the bottom of the drone so that it is oriented with the arrows pointing toward the drone's camera. You should feel it make solid connection in one spot. Swap the screwdriver bit for the Phillips head and use it to install the 2 screws from hardware bag A into the circled locations. Finger tight is fine. Do not overtighten as you can strip out the plastic threads.

3. Place the collection device on the adapter plate so that the holes line up. Use the 4 M3 screws from hardware bag B to secure them together at the 4 corners.
